    âœ¨ Highlights
    - We now support env variables in the task definition, these can also be used as default values for parameters in your task which you can overwrite with your shell's env variables. e.g. task = { cmd = "task to run", env = { VAR="value1", PATH="my/path:$PATH" } }
    - We made a big effort on fixing issues and improving documentation!
