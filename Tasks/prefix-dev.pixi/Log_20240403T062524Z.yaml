    âœ¨ Highlights
    - This release adds support for pyproject.toml, now pixi reads from the [tool.pixi] table.
    - We now support editable PyPI dependencies, and PyPI source dependencies, including git, path, and url dependencies.
    [!TIP] These new features are part of the ongoing effort to make pixi more flexible, powerful, and comfortable for the python users. They are still in progress so expect more improvements on these features soon, so please report any issues you encounter and follow our next releases!
