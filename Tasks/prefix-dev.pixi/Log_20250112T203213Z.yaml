    Release Notes
    âœ¨ Highlights
    By updating resolvo to the latest version we now significantly lower the RAM usage during the solve process. ðŸš€ As this improvement removes a huge set of data from the solve step it also speeds it up even more, especially for hard to solve environments.
    Some numbers from the resolvo PR, based on the resolve test dataset:
    - Average Solve Time: 'pixi v0.39.5' was 1.68 times faster than 'pixi v0.39.4'
    - Median Solve Time: 'pixi v0.39.5' was 1.33 times faster than 'pixi v0.39.4'
    - 25th Percentile: 'pixi v0.39.5' was 1.22 times faster than 'pixi v0.39.4'
    - 75th Percentile: 'pixi v0.39.5' was 2.28 times faster than 'pixi v0.39.4'
